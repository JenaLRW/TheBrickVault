# TheBrickVault

FYI, code contains a lot of comments.  This is my first major project and without comments, I will get lost and unfortunately, I don't have very good memory recollection either.  Bear with me. 

API Key is stored in User Secrets.
- Retrieve the API key from the director or me on Slack.
- Run in your CLI inside the project folder ```dotnet user-secrets init```
- Add the API key manually using this command: ```dotnet user-secrets set "Rebrickable:ApiKey" "the-api-key-here"```
